# Overview of Docker editions 
(https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/)

> *Community Edition (CE):* (CE) is ideal for individual developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.

> *Enterprise Edition (EE):* (EE) is designed for enterprise development and IT teams who build, ship, and run business critical applications in production at scale.
